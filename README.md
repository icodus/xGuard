Nginx Firewall

This is a kind of a fork of the famous [7G Firewall](https://exo.com/scripts/examples) by Jeff Starr 

The code here is based on Jeff Cleverley's [GridPane Nginx Configs](https://gitlab.gridpane.net/gp-public/nginx-configs) but modified to better meet Nginx standards.

So should be a bit more reliable and a bit faster most probably.
